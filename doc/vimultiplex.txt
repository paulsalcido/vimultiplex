1. About                                                    *Vimultiplex-About*

This Vim/Tmux integration is designed to give a lot more capability and
control over a single set of tmux panes.  I do this because I want to write
vimscript and learn how to control my editor of choice in a superior way, and
second because I required the ability to do more in association with vim and
tmux, because of the demands of the devops-type position that I find myself
in.  Developing something that could manage many panes, and perhaps over time,
many panes and windows, seems as good a goal as any for my first actual
plugin, outside of those I developed for tutorials and for fun.

The Vimultiplex plugin introduces an object model of control for tmux windows
with knowledge of pane ids and how those ids tie back into the pane index for
the current window, allowing for panes to be identified by name internally.
This allows panes to have a purpose from the vi perspective.

As I continue to develop this and work it towards its first real release,
please realize that the interfaces could change without warning.

2. Usage                                                    *Vimultiplex-Usage*

Vimultiplex is a typical vim plugin.  Or atypical, I'm not completely sure.

2.1 Installation                                     *Vimultiplex-Installation*

If you are using pathogen (https://github.com/tpope/pathogen/) then installing
vimultiplex involves linking or cloning the git repository for vimultiplex to
your ~/.vim/bundle directory.

2.2 Initialization                                 *Vimultiplex-Initialization*

Currently, when vimultiplex is loaded, it knows nothing about its current pane
and windows.  In order to load the global object (g:vimultiplex_main) with the
information that it needs to work effectively, you can run:

:call vimultiplex#main#start()

Or, if you want to manage your own globally named object, you can use:

:let g:my_object = vimultiplex#main#new()

2.3 Creating A Pane                                   *Vimultiplex-Create-Pane*

The main object must be initialized before creating a pane.  See
|Vimultiplex-Initialization| for more information.  After this is done, a new
pane can be created with:

:call g:vimultiplex_main.create_pane('pane_name', {})

This will start a new pane, and attach a new pane object to the dictionary
'panes' in the g:vimultiplex_main object.  It will contain the tmux id for the
new pane.

If there is already a pane with the name passed, vimultiplex will print an
error to the screen and return.

The second argument to create_pane, a dictionary, contains various options
that can be sent to the split-window command used to create a pane.  The
current options and how they map are as follows:

    * percentage: What percentage of the destination pane the new pane should
      take up.  This is the -p option in tmux split-window.
    * target: The name of the target pane that you want to split.
    * target_pane: A pane object that you want to split.  In order to avoid
      circular references, this is deleted after use.
    * horizontal: if this key exists, then the split will be horizontal.
      Since pane splitting defaults to vertical, I have not included vertical
      splits as an option.

It should be noted that if you are calling 'create_pane' on a pane object, it
will not accept 'target', but only 'target_pane'.  The main window class
resolves 'target', which is a name, into 'target_pane', which is an object.

2.4 Sending Text                                       *Vimultiplex-Send-Keys*

In order to send keys using vimultiplex, use the send_keys command, for either
the main window object or the pane object.  The following commands execute the
same thing:

:call g:vimultiplex_main.send_keys('pane_name', @@)
:call g:vimultiplex_main.panes.pane_name.send_keys(@@)

2.5 Destroying Panes                                *Vimultiplex-Destroy-Pane*

:call g:vimultiplex_main.destroy_pane('pane_name')

Will destroy a pane and remove it from the global pane list.

6. Credits                                                *Vimultiplex-Credits*

I'm not thanking Paul David Salcido, but it is who I am, should you be
interested in knowing.

I'd like to thank Steve Losh, for Learn Vimscript the Hard Way
(http://learnvimscriptthehardway.stevelosh.com), Tim Pope for pathogen and
inspiration in general, Josephine Monterosso for being so great at developing
tools in so many creative ways, Bram, obviously, Keith Nazworth for having
a bunch of impressive vim bundles (or just methods).

There are so many folks that positively impacted my career and professional
development, you now how this section is.  For now, I'll stop here.
